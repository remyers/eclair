### Channel Splicing

With this release, we add support for the final version of [splicing](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1160) that was recently added to the BOLTs.
Splicing allows node operators to change the size of their existing channels, which makes it easier and more efficient to allocate liquidity where it is most needed.
Most node operators can now have a single channel with each of their peer, which costs less on-chain fees and resources, and makes path-finding easier.

The size of an existing channel can be increased with the `splicein` API:

```sh
eclair-cli splicein --channelId=<channel_id> --amountIn=<amount_satoshis>
```

Once that transaction confirms, the additional liquidity can be used to send outgoing payments.
If the transaction doesn't confirm, the node operator can speed up confirmation with the `rbfsplice` API:

```sh
eclair-cli rbfsplice --channelId=<channel_id> --targetFeerateSatByte=<feerate_satoshis_per_byte> --fundingFeeBudgetSatoshis=<maximum_on_chain_fee_satoshis>
```

If the node operator wants to reduce the size of a channel, or send some of the channel funds to an on-chain address, they can use the `spliceout` API:

```sh
eclair-cli spliceout --channelId=<channel_id> --amountOut=<amount_satoshis> --scriptPubKey=<on_chain_address>
```

That operation can also be RBF-ed with the `rbfsplice` API to speed up confirmation if necessary.

Note that when 0-conf is used for the channel, it is not possible to RBF splice transactions.
Node operators should instead create a new splice transaction (with `splicein` or `spliceout`) to CPFP the previous transaction.

Note that eclair had already introduced support for a splicing prototype in v0.9.0, which helped improve the BOLT proposal.
We're removing support for the previous splicing prototype feature: users that depended on this protocol must upgrade to create official splice transactions.

### Package relay

With Bitcoin Core 28.1, eclair starts relying on the `submitpackage` RPC during channel force-close.
When using anchor outputs, allows propagating our local commitment transaction to peers who are also running Bitcoin Core 28.x or newer, even if the commitment feerate is low (package relay).

This removes the need for increasing the commitment feerate based on mempool conditions, which ensures that channels won't be force-closed anymore when nodes disagree on the current feerate.

### API changes

- `listoffers` now returns more details about each offer.


### Configuration changes

- The default for `eclair.features.option_channel_type` is now  `mandatory` instead of `optional`. This change prepares nodes to always assume the behavior of `option_channel_type` from peers when Bolts PR [#1232](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1232) is adopted. Until [#1232](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/1232) is adopted you can still set `option_channel_type` to `optional` in your `eclair.conf` file for specific peers that do not yet support this option, see `Configure.md` for more information.

### Miscellaneous improvements and bug fixes

#### Remove confirmation scaling based on funding amount

We previously scaled the number of confirmations based on the channel funding amount.
However, this doesn't work with splicing, where the channel capacity may change drastically.
It's much simpler to always use the same number of confirmations, while choosing a value that is large enough to protect against malicious reorgs.
We now by default use 8 confirmations, which can be modified in `eclair.conf`:

```conf
// Minimum number of confirmations for channel transactions to be safe from reorgs.
eclair.channel.min-depth-blocks = 8
```

Note however that we require `min-depth` to be at least 6 blocks, since the BOLTs require this before announcing channels.
See #3044 for more details.

## Verifying signatures

You will need `gpg` and our release signing key E04E48E72C205463. Note that you can get it:

- from our website: https://acinq.co/pgp/drouinf2.asc
- from github user @sstone, a committer on eclair: https://api.github.com/users/sstone/gpg_keys

To import our signing key:

```sh
$ gpg --import drouinf2.asc
```

To verify the release file checksums and signatures:

```sh
$ gpg -d SHA256SUMS.asc > SHA256SUMS.stripped
$ sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.stripped
```

## Building

Eclair builds are deterministic. To reproduce our builds, please use the following environment (*):

- Ubuntu 24.04.1
- Adoptium OpenJDK 21.0.6

Use the following command to generate the eclair-node package:

```sh
./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
```

That should generate `eclair-node/target/eclair-node-<version>-XXXXXXX-bin.zip` with sha256 checksums that match the one we provide and sign in `SHA256SUMS.asc`

(*) You may be able to build the exact same artefacts with other operating systems or versions of JDK 21, we have not tried everything.

## Upgrading

This release is fully compatible with previous eclair versions. You don't need to close your channels, just stop eclair, upgrade and restart.
